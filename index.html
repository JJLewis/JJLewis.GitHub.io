																<h4>A Little Bit About Me</h4>
															<div style="height:15em; overflow-y:scroll;">
																<p class="medium text-muted">
																		My interest in computers and programming began when I was in Year 7 (2011). I wanted to create something, and at the time, computer and software interested me. I started watching simple Youtube tutorials to learn. From the most basic <code>Hello World</code> iPhone app to a simple calculator app. I think that the only reason that I focus on iOS now is that I found the iPhone Simulator bundled with Xcode cool. From the completion of my first app, my interest snowballed and I began programming in my free time after school. I have started and finished many projects, but there have been some that were over my head at the time. I got my Apple Developer account under my mum's name in Year 8. Since I taught myself how to code, I found later on that I left out many rather quite important things, such as Arrays and Dictionaries... I went back and updated all my apps to be more efficient after I discovered those data types. After I felt comfortable enough in Objective-C (my first language), I played with other languages, in particular, Python and Swift when it came out. Overtime, my way of thinking and programming has changed and gotten much more efficient and readable. I have two large projects that I am very proud of, both of which should be released in the near future.<br/>
																		Recently I have been lucky enough to have been awarded the prestigious Co-op Scholarship for Computer Science to the University of New South Wales. I have commenced my studies in Computer Science now and am set to graduate at the end of 2020.

														Here, I place all of the projects that were either never started or abondoned, as a reminder of my roots and as a way to see how far I have come.<br/>

														<h3>Disease Identifier</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 7 July 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> 12 September 2012</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Rejected from the AppStore due to poor quality images.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>This app was made as a project in conjunction with the Math, Science, and Religion department of my school for an assignment / competition. It came first, and I tried to upload it to the AppStore, but the images I used were a bit graphic and of poor quality, so was rejected. I found no point in further pursuing this app, as it was quite limited in functionality and had already served its purpose in winning the competition, and getting me free tickets to the movies.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Card Counters</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 17 July 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Got extremely repetitive and boring. Nothing to be learnt. No real use for app.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A series of small apps specialising on one method of card counting, and one larger app, an amalgamation of the smaller ones. The idea was to simple tap on the card that was dealt around the table as it happened and a <em>'count'</em> on the screen will update accordingly. The card counting methods were:</p>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li>Hi-Lo</li>
																<li>Hi-Opt 1</li>
																<li>Hi-Opt 2</li>
																<li>KO</li>
																<li>Omega 2</li>
																<li>Zen</li>
																<li>AIO (All in One)</li>
														</ul>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>QuickTaps</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 28 July 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Created Project - Never Started</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A simple reaction speed game, where the players would respond to a stimulus on the screen and tap a button. I never really had the motivation to actually start coding this project since there were heaps of similar apps on the AppStore, and I didn't want to make another / a copy.</p>
																</div>
														<div>
														<h3>SoI</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 27 August 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Sometime after 20 September 2012</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Twas a school assignment that had no place on the AppStore.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The app name SoI is short for Sacraments of Initiation, and this was an app thats sole purpose was to both demonstrate my knowledge or the Sacraments of Initiation in Christianity in an interactive manner, and also show and educate other about those Sacraments. This app featured very poor, MS Paint style graphics and its fair share of harsh gradients. It was abondoned mainly because it looked terrible, but because I didn't think it would serve much of a purpose out of the assignment context.</p>
																</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Teacher's Pet</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 13 September 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Barely started, didn't like the idea.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>This app was supposed to be a tool for teacher to use in class to aid their teaching. It would feature things like a class list, a way to track marks and homework, and a random student picker, for those times when no one volunteers for something. Some code was written, but I think I found a better, more interesting project to work on.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<div>
														<h3>KeyChain</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 18 September 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Project Created - Never Started</li>
														</ul>
														<p>This was going to be a password manager, but I found 1Password and others. I also wasn't sure how to make something secure enough to store people's passwords. I didn't want to make something even I wouldn't use.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>iTorch</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 29 September 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Poor UI Design. Apple came out with Control Centre and its Flashlight short cut.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
																In this project, I was planning to make a smart flashlight app, byt accepting text input and outputting morse code from the light.<br/>
																In the priecess of making this app, I added a strobe feature, and found that if I turned the speed at which the light turns on and off fast enough, the light looks like it had dimmed to half brightness.<br/>
																I had unexpectedly stumbled across Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
																</p>
														</div>
														<h3>Omega Feeds</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 29 October 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Project Created - Never started due to no information from client.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
																This app was supposed to something like a store finder/mobile app for a friend's family's horse feed business. The friend and I thought it was a great idea, but I never got the required information so the app was never started.
																</p>
																</div>
														<div>
														<h3>PocketBoard</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 24 December 2012</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Insufficient knowledge lead to project getting out of hand.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A smart scoreboard app for coaches to use at sporting events to keep digital records of games. This was targetted at school boy coaches. Game data was outputted as a CSV.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>FaceFighter</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 7 February 2013</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Tried to make my own 2D physics and tile game engine before understanding how it should all work.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The idea behind this app was that you had a stick figure player, where you could place a picture of your face onto and fight other players. The game was supposed to edit your face to reflect how much damage you have.<br/>
																This didn't work out because I tried to make a tile game engine and simple physics engine without knowing how to properly manage memory and resources, causing the game to lag alot and be unplayable, particularly when gravity came in play.
																</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Kitchen Helper</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 1 June 2013</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Project Created - Never Started</li>
														</ul>
														<p>A request from my mother for an app that allows you to monitor all the food in the kitchen and fridge. Also, the app should give you recipes for food you can make with the food you have right now. Didn't start because I had no idea how I'd design the UI to be usable.</p>
																</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Infinite</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 25 July 2013</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Never started due to other projects and school work.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
																The idea for this, was a simple game where the player is a turret at the centre of the screen and shoots enemies that approach it. If one make it to the centre, game over. I hoped to learn how to use SpriteKit out of this project.
														</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>FaceFighter 2</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 23 October 2013</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> N/A</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Never really started. I figured the app idea wasn't worth pursuing.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>Planned on using KoboldKit as the game engine to actually make this idea work, but figured out there had to be a significant change in how the tile maps were designed and stored. For me, I figured the effort it would have taken to make this project work, was not justified by the marketability of the idea or the final product.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Queue</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 3 June 2014</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> 18 October 2014</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Apple announced Up Next in iOS, and figured the market for this would be tiny.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>This was supposed to be a port of the Up Next feature in iTunes so that you can see what songs will play next and modify that queue / list. I made the UI Mockups for this, which looked really good, but just as I was starting the code for this project, I found that nobody, if any would probably even download and use this app, since it only provides one new function over the stock Music app. Also Apple's new version of iOS was announced and set to bring this very feature to the stock Music app.</p>
														</div>
														<div>
														<h3>Irreplacable</h3>
														<ul class="list-inline">
																<li><b>Created:</b> 6 December 2014</li>
																<li><b>Date Abandoned:</b> Unknown</li>
																<li><b>Reason:</b> Poor UI/UX design. Final product would have been too difficult to use.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
																This was supposed to be a calculator app where by the user can assign values to pro-numerals and use them in forming a formula to run a calculation, whereby the pronumerals will be replaced with the values that were assigned to them. This I thought would be handy in Math, as the same formula can be used multiple times, and changing the values every time would require re-entering the formula. However, in creating the majority of the functionality of this app, I found it was about equally as tedious to do as re-entering the formula, so decided to drop this project.<br/>
																This project was predominantly built around <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser">Dave Delong's DDMathParser</a>.

														<h2>Decider</h2>
														<p class="item-intro text-muted">My first ever public app.</p>
														<img class="img-responsive col-md-3" src="img/apps/Decider/Screenshots/2.png" alt="">
														<img class="img-responsive col-md-3" src="img/apps/Decider/Screenshots/3.png" alt="">

														<img class="img-responsive col-md-3" src="img/apps/Decider/Screenshots/5.png" alt="">
														<p>Decider was the first iOS app that I ever wrote. Back when I was in Year 8, I wrote this app. Back then, my knowledge of algorithms was super close to zero. The only control structures/language functions I new at the time was IF statements, how to assign a text value to a UITextfield, and how to generate random numbers into an int variable. Other than that, all of the GUI was done in a Storyboard file and individual classes where created to match each ViewController. There were literally 1000s of lines of duplicate code and meaningless rubbish at the time. I wish I still had the project file, it’s gone somewhere now, but I’ll be sure to post it when I do find it. It will likely make quite a few developers out there keel over and cry.<br/><br/>


The good news is, though, that I completely rewrote the app in Swift, funnily enough, as a way to learn Swift. This time though, I knew how to handle loops, arrays, dictionaries, and other programming language features. At the moment, I fear opening the Swift project because since the Swift syntax has changed since the last time I had opened it. I fear being smacked in the face with tens or even hundreds of little red triangles that tell me XCode can’t compile the project due to syntax issues.<br/><br/>

When I first released Decider, all I wanted was about 100 people to pay $0.99 for the app so I could make my membership fees back. Unfortunately things didn’t go so well… So I added banner ads everywhere and made the app free.<br/><br/>
																Try it out! It should be quite ok/usable now.

														<p>Simple Interest Calculator was an app I wrote in two days. It became the foundation of my next two calculator apps, Compound Interest Calculator with Graph and Tip Calculator.

														<h2>DodgeBall</h2>
														<p class="item-intro text-muted">A small step into game development.</p>
														<img class="img-responsive col-md-6" src="img/apps/DodgeBall/Screenshots/Version-2/1.jpg" alt="">
														<img class="img-responsive col-md-6" src="img/apps/DodgeBall/Screenshots/Version-2/2.jpg" alt="">
														<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
														<p>This is a free update to DodgeBall. Unlike a conventional update to an
														app, this is a complete rewrite of the app from the ground up, making use
														of Apple’s SpriteKit for the game engine. This provides a much smoother 60
														FPS game with nicer animations and infinitely more accurate collision
														detection. In addition to this, I have removed the old sound effects for
														better higher quality sound effects.<br>
														There is now Game Centre integration so that you can easily compare scores
														with friends and challenge each other to see who can get the highest score.
														(Note the score is based on how long you can last without being hit by a
														red ball.)<br>
														There are also score achievements as follows:</p>
														<ol>
																<li>Survive 30 Seconds (10 Points)</li>
																<li>Survive 45 Seconds (25 Points)</li>
																<li>Survive 60 Seconds (50 Points)</li>
																<li>Survive 90 Seconds (75 Points)</li>
																<li>Survive 120 Seconds (100 Points)</li>
														</ol>
														<p>Along with this, there are total game play time achievements as
														follows:</p>
														<ol>
																<li>Play for 15 Minutes (10 Points)</li>
																<li>Play for 30 Minutes (25 Points)</li>
																<li>Play for 60 Minutes (50 Points)</li>
																<li>Play for 24 Hours (100 Points) (I don’t expect anybody to get this
																one)</li>
														</ol>
														<p>Since the game is now free, I can recommend for you to give it a try, it
														weighs in at 33.9MB *or less, so maybe download it on Wi-Fi.<br>
														You can download it here.<br>
														If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me here.<br>
														* Depends on whether the app gets thinned by Apple when you download
														it.</p>

														<p>My first attempt at a game. Here’s a brief overview:</p>
														<ol>
																<li>The graphics suck.</li>
																<li>The game is glitchy.</li>
																<li>It costs $0.99</li>
																<li>It has in app purchases.</li>
														</ol>
														<p>In short, it sucks.<br>
														I plan on completely rewriting it using Sprite it and releasing it for
														free.<br>
														Not much more to say, other than some unfortunate people have spent $0.99
														on this and probably immediately regretted it.</p>

														Crypto was an app I had wanted to make since I was in Year 7. I thought the idea was cool at the time, until I realised after completing it, that it would be a pain in the ass to use.
<br/>
The function of the app is to take in some text, work some magic on it, and then spit out a new bit of text. It can also reverse this process and return normal readable text.
<br/>
You can also create your own scheme with this, so you can make your own private communication thing within your friend group, but at the moment there is no way to share profiles, so you will have to manually setup each device, which is a further pain in the ass.

														 Tip Calculator was written in a day… Or more like a few hours because I had nothing much better to do.
<br/>
It was made by changing the math, look and colour scheme of Simple Interest Calculator. There’s not much to it…
<br/>
I think that’s all I have to say about this app. It’s not very fascinating.

														This app was written over a weekend when I had nothing much more to do. Also I thought it might come in handy since the math behind it can be complicating for somebody to remember or do on the spot. As a bonus you can even see how your investment exponentially increases as time goes by with the built in graph function.
														<br/>
														Next in line would be adding regular investments to the app.

														This was written when I was in Year 10 in 2014, and to be honest, it was 2 years ahead of its time. Transport for NSW had not yet opened to the fact that their paper based logbooks were out of date. Despite taking me 6 months during my free time to create and perfect, it went no where.<br/>
														The purpose of this app is to fully replace your paper logbook for logging your hours in NSW. It does this by having three main functions:
														</p>
														<ol>
																<li>Automatically Log Drive</li>
																<li>Manually Log Drive</li>
																<li>Manually Log Lesson</li>
														</ol>
														<p>
																Automatically Log Drive makes use of the GPS function of the phone it is running on to log where the learner is driving and their speed. By doing this, it adds another dimension to the learning experience as the learner can see where they had driven and their speed habits.<br/>
																Most, if not all functionality that could be automated was automated, this includes:
														</p>
														<ul>
																<li>Calculating Day and Night hours based on the day's sunrise and sunset times.</li>
																<li>Fetching Weather to have a more accurate depiction of the learner's driving conditions.</li>
																<li>Predictive odometer values based off of the distance travelled in the drive.</li>
																<li>Entering Supervisor and Vehicle data, by saving presets for them.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>
																This app will soon under go the process of bringing it back up to date from 2 years ago. It will also have a significant UI/UX makeover as I fight the uphill war to get this now approved for official use by learner drivers around the state of New South Wales.

														<h2>The Force Project</h2>
														<p class="item-intro text-muted">My greatest creation so far.</p>
														<img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="height:40vh;" src="/img/apps/Force/Screenshots/1.png" alt="">
														<p>
														The Force Project is my greatest project so far. It is a universal remote for all personal projects, and an awesome tool for people looking to create their own Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It features a super simple to use, user interface designer, so that you can create any interface by using Force's modular tile system. Each tile is a direct implementation of Apple's UIKit, and all attributes are customisable, meaning that the possibilities are endless. Force also has extended tiles, such as Joysticks, MJPEG Stream Viewers, and Myo by Thalmic.<br/>
														Using Force is as easy as downloading the server script and template, then figuring out how you want to use the data you receive from your user interface that you made. In essence, it is like a universal remote control for all projects.<br/>
														With Force, my ultimate goal is to empower people to easily create awesome projects and share it with the world. So that more people can discover the fun of creating something and using it or seeing it work.

																So, remember back in the day when every app had a paid version, lite version, and a HD version??
<br/>
That’s what I tried to do with Decider and Decider Lite. Back when I had Decider as a paid app, I had this for potential buyers to try out and see if they actually wanted to buy Decider. Since then, I noticed the turnover from Lite to Paid was too low to even bother having and supporting two versions of the app. So I made Decider free and let this one stay on the AppStore.
<br/>
I still get downloads of Decider Lite to this day. Be it a couple every month at most.
<br/>
Also… How ugly is the UI and Icon??? I can’t believe I thought that looked good.
